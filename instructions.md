# **Building a Nyan Cat Themed Landing Page with Next.js, Pages Router, and Tailwind CSS**

### **Part 0: Introduction \- Setting the Stage for Interstellar Web Design**

#### **Project Overview**

This tutorial will guide you through the process of building a visually rich and interactive landing page that blends nostalgic pixel art with modern web development techniques. We will construct a fully animated, Nyan Cat themed experience from the ground up. The project leverages the robust architecture of Next.js, the utility-first efficiency of Tailwind CSS, and the power of custom CSS animations to create a dynamic, engaging user interface.

#### **Technical Goals**

The primary objective is to provide a practical, expert-level demonstration of several key front-end concepts. We will focus on the seamless integration of custom @keyframes animations directly within the Tailwind CSS configuration, the architectural approach to creating a multi-layered, full-screen animated background, and the precise implementation of the popular "glassmorphism" UI trend for interactive content cards. The final product will be a performant, statically generated site, optimized for modern desktop browsers.

#### **Final Product Preview**

Upon completion, the landing page will be animated with a gentle bobbing motion, flying across a horizontally scrolling starfield. This entire scene will serve as a full-screen background. Overlaid on this dynamic canvas will be a series of sleek, interactive "glassmorphism" cards that appear to float in the foreground, responding to user interaction with smooth, satisfying hover effects.

### **Part 1: Project Initialization and Core Configuration**

#### **1.1. Bootstrapping the Next.js Project with Pages Router**

The foundation of our project is a clean Next.js installation. We will use create-next-app, the official and industry-standard command-line interface (CLI) for bootstrapping Next.js applications.

Open your terminal and run the following command:

Bash

npx create-next-app@latest nyan-cat-landing

The CLI will present a series of interactive prompts to configure the project. Your selections for these prompts are critical to aligning with this tutorial's architecture.

* What is your project named? › nyan-cat-landing  
* Would you like to use TypeScript? › No  
* Would you like to use ESLint? › Yes  
* Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? › **Yes**  
* Would you like to use src/ directory? › No  
* Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) › **No**  
* Would you like to customize the default import alias? › No

The most crucial choice here is declining the App Router. The Next.js ecosystem has shifted to promoting the App Router as the default and recommended paradigm. Consequently, many contemporary guides and the CLI itself default to this new architecture. Opting out by selecting **No** ensures our project is scaffolded with the **Pages Router**, which utilizes a distinct file structure centered around the pages directory, including the critical pages/_app.js file. Failing to make this selection would result in a project structure incompatible with the steps that follow, a common point of friction for developers navigating the framework's evolution.

Once the installation is complete, navigate into your new project directory:

Bash

cd nyan-cat-landing

#### **1.2. Sourcing and Organizing Static Assets**

Next.js serves static files, such as images, fonts, and icons, from a top-level public directory. Files placed here are not processed by the build pipeline and can be referenced directly from the root of the application URL. This makes it the ideal location for assets we want to serve "as-is."

Create the public directory in the root of your project. Inside this directory, you will need to place two assets:

1. stars.png: A seamless, tileable image of a starfield.

Your project structure should now include:

nyan-cat-landing/  
├── public/  
│   └── stars.png  
...

The choice to use the public directory is a deliberate architectural decision. While Next.js can import images directly into components for optimization, this process is designed for static formats like JPEG and PNG.

#### **1.3. Defining Custom Animations in tailwind.config.js**

To bring our scene to life, we need custom animations. While these could be defined in a separate CSS file, the most robust and scalable method is to extend Tailwind's theme directly in the tailwind.config.js file. This approach elevates our custom animations to first-class utilities, allowing them to be combined with Tailwind's powerful variant system (e.g., hover:, md:).

Open tailwind.config.js and modify the theme.extend object to include new keyframes and animation definitions.

JavaScript

/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */  
module.exports \= {  
  content: \[  
    './pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',  
    './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',  
  \],  
  theme: {  
    extend: {  
      keyframes: {  
        'scroll-bg': {  
          '0%': { transform: 'translateX(0)' },  
          '100%': { transform: 'translateX(-100%)' },  
        },  
        bobbing: {  
          '0%, 100%': { transform: 'translateY(-4%)' },  
          '50%': { transform: 'translateY(4%)' },  
        },  
      },  
      animation: {  
        'scroll-bg': 'scroll-bg s linear infinite',  
        bobbing: 'bobbing s ease-in-out infinite',  
      },  
    },  
  },  
  plugins:,  
};

By defining these within the configuration file, we are not merely adding CSS; we are extending Tailwind's design system. The animate-scroll-bg and animate-bobbing classes are now available throughout our project, just like any built-in utility.

The following table breaks down these additions for clarity:

| Configuration Key | Property | Value | Rationale & Description |
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
| theme.extend.keyframes | scroll-bg | { '0%': { transform: 'translateX(0)' }, '100%': { transform: 'translateX(-100%)' } } | Defines the keyframes for a seamless horizontal scroll. Translating by \-100% moves the element exactly its own width to the left, which is essential for looping a tileable image without a visible jump. |
| theme.extend.keyframes | bobbing | { '0%, 100%': { transform: 'translateY(-4%)' }, '50%': { transform: 'translateY(4%)' } } | Defines the keyframes for a gentle, continuous up-and-down movement. Using percentages for translateY makes the animation's magnitude relative to the element's size, ensuring it scales appropriately. |
| theme.extend.animation | scroll-bg | 'scroll-bg s linear infinite' | Registers the scroll-bg keyframes as a utility class (animate-scroll-bg). The s duration creates a slow, mesmerizing pan, linear ensures a constant, non-accelerating speed, and infinite loops the animation. |
| theme.extend.animation | bobbing | 'bobbing s ease-in-out infinite' | Registers the bobbing keyframes as a utility class (animate-bobbing). The s duration and ease-in-out timing function create a smooth, natural-feeling oscillation that speeds up and slows down at the peaks and troughs. |

### **Part 2: Crafting the Animated Nyan Cat Background**

#### **2.1. Component Architecture: \<NyanBackground /\>**

To maintain a clean and modular codebase, we will encapsulate all background-related logic and styling into a dedicated, reusable component.

Create a components directory in your project root. Inside it, create a new file named NyanBackground.js.

#### **2.2. Styling the Full-Screen Canvas**

This component will render a multi-layered background that is fixed to the viewport. The outermost container will establish the full-screen canvas, while inner elements will handle the scrolling starfield.

Add the following code to components/NyanBackground.js:

JavaScript

import Image from 'next/image';

const NyanBackground \= () \=\> {  
  return (  
    \<div className\="fixed inset-0 \-z-10 overflow-hidden"\>  
      {/* Starfield Layer */}  
      \<div  
        className\="absolute inset-0 w-\[200%\] h-full bg-\[url('/stars.png')\] bg-repeat animate-scroll-bg"  
        style\={{ backgroundSize: 'px px' }}  
      /\>  
      \</div\>  
    \</div\>  
  );  
};

export default NyanBackground;

Let's break down the key Tailwind classes:

* fixed inset-0 \-z-10: This combination is a robust pattern for creating full-screen backgrounds. fixed positions the element relative to the viewport. inset-0 is shorthand for top: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; left: 0;, stretching it to cover the entire screen. \-z-10 places it on a lower stacking layer, ensuring it sits behind all other page content.  
* w-\[200%\]: This is applied to the starfield layer. By making the background image container twice the width of the screen, we provide the necessary "off-screen" space for our scroll-bg animation to translate the image by its full width (-100%) before looping, creating a perfectly seamless pan.

#### **2.3. Applying the Custom Scrolling Animation**

The animate-scroll-bg class, which we defined in our Tailwind config, is applied directly to the starfield div. This immediately links our custom keyframes to the element, initiating the continuous horizontal panning effect.

### **Part 3: Designing Interactive Glassmorphism Cards**

#### **3.1. Component Architecture: \<Card /\>**

Following our modular approach, we will create another reusable component for our content cards. This component will be designed to accept props, making it flexible enough to display various types of content.

Create a new file at components/Card.js.

#### **3.2. Achieving the Glassmorphism Effect with Tailwind CSS**

The "glassmorphism" or "frosted glass" effect is a popular UI trend that relies on a combination of transparency, blur, and subtle borders to create a sense of depth. Tailwind CSS provides all the necessary utilities to achieve this effect with precision.

Add the following code to components/Card.js:

JavaScript

const Card \= ({ title, children }) \=\> {  
  return (  
    \<div className\="w-full max-w-sm p-6 bg-white/10 backdrop-blur-lg rounded-xl border border-white/20 shadow-lg transition-transform duration-300 hover:scale-105 hover:-translate-y-2"\>  
      \<h className\="text-xl font-bold text-white mb-4"\>{title}\</h\>  
      \<div className\="text-gray-200"\>{children}\</div\>  
    \</div\>  
  );  
};

export default Card;

The core of the glassmorphism effect is achieved through this chain of classes:

* bg-white/10: Creates a semi-transparent white background. The low opacity is essential for the frosted look.  
* backdrop-blur-lg: This is the most important utility. It applies a blur filter not to the element itself, but to everything *behind* it in the z-axis, creating the signature frosted glass appearance.  
* rounded-xl: Applies a generous border radius for a soft, modern aesthetic.  
* border border-white/20: A subtle, semi-transparent white border helps to define the card's edges against the busy, animated background.  
* shadow-lg: A soft drop shadow adds a final layer of depth, making the card feel like it is floating above the background.

The visual impact of glassmorphism is relational; it is defined by its interaction with the layers beneath it. An effect like this would be nearly invisible against a plain, solid background. The decision to build our complex, animated background *first* was intentional, as it provides the necessary visual context for the glassmorphism to be both technically functional and aesthetically striking.

#### **3.3. Implementing Fluid Hover Effects**

To make the cards feel responsive and engaging, we add a multi-part hover effect using Tailwind's state variants and transition utilities.

* transition-transform duration-300: This class must be present in the element's base state. It instructs the browser to smoothly animate any changes to the transform property over a period of 300 milliseconds.  
* hover:scale-105: On hover, the card's size is increased by 5%.  
* hover:-translate-y-2: Simultaneously, the card is moved upward by 2 units (0.rem).

Combining a scale and a translate transform on hover creates a more dynamic and satisfying 3D effect than either would alone, making the card feel like it is lifting off the page toward the user.

### **Part 4: Assembling the Landing Page Layout**

#### **4.1. Establishing Global Styles and Fonts**

Global styles, including font imports and base element styling, are best handled in a central CSS file. In a Pages Router project, this file is typically styles/globals.css.

Open styles/globals.css and replace its contents with the following:

CSS

@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Press+Start+2P\&display=swap');

@tailwind base;  
@tailwind components;  
@tailwind utilities;

body {  
  font-family: 'Press Start 2P', cursive;  
  background-color: \#ac; /* A dark blue-gray fallback */  
}

Here, we use the standard CSS @import rule to fetch the "Press Start 2P" font from Google Fonts, which has a pixelated style that complements our theme. We then apply this font to the body element, making it the default for our entire application. A dark background-color is also set as a base layer.

#### **4.2. Configuring the App Shell in pages/_app.js**

In the Pages Router architecture, the pages/_app.js file serves as the top-level component that wraps every page. This makes it the one and only correct location to import global stylesheets to ensure they are applied consistently across the application.

Open pages/_app.js and ensure it imports globals.css:

JavaScript

import '../styles/globals.css';

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {  
  return \<Component {...pageProps} /\>;  
}

export default MyApp;

#### **4.3. Structuring the Main Page (pages/index.js)**

Now we assemble all our components into the final page layout.

Open pages/index.js, clear out any boilerplate code, and replace it with the following structure:

JavaScript

import Head from 'next/head';  
import NyanBackground from '../components/NyanBackground';  
import Card from '../components/Card';

// Sample data for our cards  
const cardData \=;

export default function Home() {  
  return (  
    \<\>  
      \<Head\>  
        \<title\>Nyan Cat Landing Page\</title\>  
        \<meta name\="description" content\="A demo landing page with Next.js, Pages Router, and Tailwind CSS" /\>  
        \<link rel\="icon" href\="/favicon.ico" /\>  
      \</Head\>

      \<NyanBackground /\>

      \<main className\="relative flex min-h-screen items-center justify-center p-4"\>  
        \<div className\="grid gap-8 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3"\>  
          {cardData.map((card, index) \=\> (  
            \<Card key\={index} title\={card.title}\>  
              \<p\>{card.content}\</p\>  
            \</Card\>  
          ))}  
        \</div\>  
      \</main\>  
    \</\>  
  );  
}

The page is structured with our \<NyanBackground /\> component at the top level. The \<main\> element, which contains our cards, is styled to center its content. The classes flex min-h-screen items-center justify-center create a flex container that spans the full viewport height and perfectly centers its children both vertically and horizontally—a common and effective layout pattern. The relative class is added to ensure the main content renders on top of the fixed-position background.

#### **4.4. Dynamically Rendering Content**

To showcase the reusability of the \<Card /\> component, we define a simple cardData array. Using JavaScript's .map() method, we iterate over this array and render a \<Card\> for each item. The title and content for each card are passed down as props, demonstrating a fundamental React pattern for rendering dynamic lists of data. A responsive grid layout (grid, md:grid-cols-2, lg:grid-cols-3) is used to arrange the cards attractively on different screen sizes.

### **Part 5: Final Code Review and Deployment Strategy**

#### **5.1. Final Project Structure Summary**

After completing all the steps, your project's file structure should be organized as follows. This clean separation of concerns—components, pages, static assets, and styles—is a hallmark of a well-structured Next.js application.

nyan-cat-landing/  
├── components/  
│   ├── Card.js  
│   └── NyanBackground.js  
├── pages/  
│   ├── _app.js  
│   └── index.js  
├── public/
│   └── stars.png  
├── styles/  
│   └── globals.css  
├── tailwind.config.js  
├── package.json  
└── next.config.js

#### **5.2. Deployment Considerations for Static Sites**

This project was intentionally designed without server-side data fetching (e.g., getServerSideProps) or API routes. This means it can be fully pre-rendered into static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files at build time. This architectural choice makes it a perfect candidate for Static Site Generation (SSG).

The output of the next build command is a collection of highly optimized, self-contained static assets. This output can be deployed to any static hosting provider, but it is particularly well-suited for modern edge platforms like Vercel (the creators of Next.js) and Netlify.

These platforms are built around a global Content Delivery Network (CDN). When you deploy a static site, its files are distributed across numerous servers worldwide. This means that when a user visits your site, the content is served from the location geographically closest to them, resulting in exceptionally low latency and fast load times. The decision to build a purely static site enables a deployment strategy that is not only incredibly performant but also highly scalable and cost-effective, as it removes the need for a continuously running server.

To deploy, you can connect your Git repository (e.g., on GitHub) to a Vercel or Netlify account. These platforms will automatically detect the Next.js framework, run the build command, and deploy the static output to their global edge network with zero configuration, providing a seamless continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) workflow.
